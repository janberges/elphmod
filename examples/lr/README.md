# Long-range terms in PHonon, EPW, and elphmod

This example verifies that PHonon, EPW, and elphmod yield identical long-range
terms for phonons and coupling.

The values of the quadrupole tensors originate from Ponc√©, Royo, Gibertini,
Marzari, and Stengel, *Accurate prediction of Hall mobilities in two-dimensional
materials through gauge-covariant quadrupolar contributions* [Phys. Rev. Lett.
**130**, 166301 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.166301).

To get the coupling from EPW, you need a modified version of Quantum ESPRESSO.
You can use the provided [patch](../../patches) to apply the required changes.
