# Phonon renormalization (TaSâ‚‚)

This example shows how to

* perform a cDFPT calculation [Nomura & Arita, PRB 92, 245108 (2015)],
* work with electrons, phonons, and their coupling in localized bases,
* consistently renormalize phonon dispersions (go from cDFPT to DFPT).

For the cDFPT part, you need a modified version of Quantum ESPRESSO. You
can use the provided patches to apply the required changes.

The results obtained in this example are very far from converged! In return,
the ab initio part takes less than a minute on a laptop with only two cores.

After the main calculation, two further scripts show how to

* extract the deformation potential from the output of the EPW code,
* check if the hopping parameters from Wannier90 decay appropriately.
