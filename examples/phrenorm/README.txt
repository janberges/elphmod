Phonon renormalization in 1H-TaS2

This example shows how to

    ~ perform a cDFPT calculation [Nomura, Arita: PRB 92, 245108 (2015)]
    ~ work with electrons, phonons, and their coupling in localized bases
    ~ consistently renormalize phonon dispersions (go from cDFPT to DFPT)

For the cDFPT part, you need a modified version of Quantum ESPRESSO. You can
find the relevant source files in the repository "qe-mod" on the same server
from where you downloaded "elphmod".

The results obtained in this example are very far from converged! In return,
the ab initio part takes less than a minute on a laptop with only two cores.
