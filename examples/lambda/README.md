# Electron-phonon coupling for superconductivity

This example shows how to compute the effective electron-phonon coupling and
phonon frequency and estimate the critical temperature of superconductivity
using McMillan's formula. Note that the results are far from converged!

To get the coupling from EPW, you need a modified version of Quantum ESPRESSO.
You can use the provided [patch](../../patches) to apply the required changes.
