# Comparison of couplings from PHonon and EPW

This example compares the electron-phonon matrix elements obtained from the
PHonon and EPW codes. No agreement is expected for degenerate states.

To get the data from PHonon, you need a modified version of Quantum ESPRESSO.
You can use the provided patches to apply the required changes.
