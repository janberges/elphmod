# elphmod examples

This directory contains examples that demonstrate the different functionalities
of elphmod. To run them, the scripts `run.sh` can be used.

The versions of the installed elphmod and of the examples must match. To ensure
this, go to the appropriate revision of this repository:

    git checkout v`python3 -c 'import elphmod; print(elphmod.__version__)'`

Also make sure to install the Python requirements before:

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

(Installing PyQt5 is only necessary if the Tk interface is not available.)
