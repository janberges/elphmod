# Fluctuation diagnostics of phonon anomalies in 1H-TaS2

This example will show how to plot the k-resolved phonon self-energy, bare
electronic susceptibility, and electron-phonon coupling at the origin of the
charge-density wave in monolayer TaS2 [cf. Fig. 3 (a-c) of Phys. Rev. B 101,
155107 (2020)].
